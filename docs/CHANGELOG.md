# Commit: repo bootstrap
- Created repo `sdr-agent-internal`
- Added `/docs/PLAN.md` with end-to-end tutor-led plan
- Established folder structure for prompts/schemas/samples/knowledge

# Commit: output contracts
- Added `/schemas/sdr-package.schema.json` (master schema for SDR outputs)
- Added `/samples/campaign.input.sample.json` (seed input)
- Decision: all agent outputs must validate against these schemas
